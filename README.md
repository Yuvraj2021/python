    Set up the Development Environment:
        Install Python and the necessary libraries (e.g., OpenCV, TensorFlow, or PyTorch) using package managers like pip or Anaconda.

    Download the Required Files:
        Download the pre-trained YOLO model weights file ("yolov3.weights") from the official YOLO website.
        Download the COCO dataset, including the image files and annotation files, from the official COCO dataset website.

    Set up the Webcam:
        Connect a webcam to your computer and ensure it is functioning properly.

    Load the Pre-trained YOLO Model:
        Load the YOLO model weights file into your project using OpenCV or other suitable libraries.

    Prepare the COCO Dataset:
        Locate the downloaded COCO dataset annotation files and images.
        Ensure that the annotation files and corresponding image files are properly organized and accessible.

    Capture and Process Webcam Frames:
        Use OpenCV to continuously capture frames from the webcam's video stream.
        Preprocess the captured frames, such as resizing or normalizing, to match the input requirements of the YOLO model.

    Perform Real-Time Object Detection:
        Apply the YOLO model to each captured frame to detect objects.
        Process the output of the model to obtain the object bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores.

    Visualize the Results:
        Draw bounding boxes on the frame using OpenCV, overlaying them on the detected objects.
        Display the resulting frame with the overlaid bounding boxes and labels in a separate window using OpenCV.

    Optimize Performance:
        Experiment with techniques like frame skipping, reducing input image size, or utilizing hardware acceleration (e.g., GPU) to achieve real-time object detection.

    Test and Evaluate:

    Test the application with different objects and various lighting conditions.
    Evaluate the performance in terms of detection accuracy, processing speed, and the ability to handle different object scales.
