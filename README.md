THE MAIN.PY CONTAINS CODE OF REAL TIME OBJECT RECOGNITION USING WEBCAM
DEPENDENCIES ARE
1 Verify that you have the correct versions of OpenCV and its dependencies installed. You can try upgrading to the latest versions using pip install --upgrade opencv-python.

2 Double-check that you have the correct versions of the YOLO model weights, configuration file, and the coco.names file. Ensure that they are placed in the same directory as your Python script.

3 Check if the YOLO model files (yolov3.weights and yolov3.cfg) were properly downloaded and are not corrupt. You may try re-downloading them from the official source.
YOLO WEIGHTS IS MISSING IN THE REPO YOU CAN DOWNLOAD IT WITH FOLLOWING STEPS AS FOLLOWS
    Visit the official YOLO website: https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/
    Scroll down to the section titled "YOLOv3" and locate the "Darknet" heading.
    Click on the "YOLOv3 Weights" link to download the pre-trained model weights file. The file is named "yolov3.weights".
    
    
    Set up the Development Environment:
        Install Python and the necessary libraries (e.g., OpenCV, TensorFlow, or PyTorch) using package managers like pip or Anaconda.

    Download the Required Files:
        Download the pre-trained YOLO model weights file ("yolov3.weights") from the official YOLO website.
        Download the COCO dataset, including the image files and annotation files, from the official COCO dataset website.

    Set up the Webcam:
        Connect a webcam to your computer and ensure it is functioning properly.

    Load the Pre-trained YOLO Model:
        Load the YOLO model weights file into your project using OpenCV or other suitable libraries.

    Prepare the COCO Dataset:
        Locate the downloaded COCO dataset annotation files and images.
        Ensure that the annotation files and corresponding image files are properly organized and accessible.

    Capture and Process Webcam Frames:
        Use OpenCV to continuously capture frames from the webcam's video stream.
        Preprocess the captured frames, such as resizing or normalizing, to match the input requirements of the YOLO model.

    Perform Real-Time Object Detection:
        Apply the YOLO model to each captured frame to detect objects.
        Process the output of the model to obtain the object bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores.

    Visualize the Results:
        Draw bounding boxes on the frame using OpenCV, overlaying them on the detected objects.
        Display the resulting frame with the overlaid bounding boxes and labels in a separate window using OpenCV.

    Optimize Performance:
        Experiment with techniques like frame skipping, reducing input image size, or utilizing hardware acceleration (e.g., GPU) to achieve real-time object detection.

    Test and Evaluate:

    Test the application with different objects and various lighting conditions.
    Evaluate the performance in terms of detection accuracy, processing speed, and the ability to handle different object scales.
